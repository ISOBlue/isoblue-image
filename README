Toradex oe-core Setup
=====================

To simplify installation we provide a repo manifest which manages the different git repositories 
and the used versions. (more on repo: http://code.google.com/p/git-repo/ )

Install the repo bootstrap binary:

  mkdir ~/bin
  PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
  chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Create a directory for your oe-core setup to live in and clone the meta information.

  mkdir oe-core
  cd oe-core
  repo init -u http://git.toradex.com/toradex-bsp-platform.git -b master
  repo sync

Optionally create a development branch in all git repositories

  repo start mybranch --all

Source the file export to setup the environment. On first invocation this also copies a sample 
configuration to build/conf/*.conf.

  . export

Adapt build/conf/local.conf to your needs. At least check the variables BB_NUMBER_THREADS, 
PARALLEL_MAKE, and MACHINE. Set MACHINE to a preferred value and when you need a different 
one override it from the command line.

For Toradex modules the following machines exist:

  apalis-t30
  colibri-t20
  colibri-t30
  colibri-vf50

e.g. set in local.conf

  MACHINE ?= "colibri-t30"

and then if you want to build for Apalis T30 instead, use the following command line:

  MACHINE=apalis-t30 bitbake angstrom-lxde-image
