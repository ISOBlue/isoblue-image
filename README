Toradex oe-core setup
=====================

Setting up an oe-core setup with the help of repo.
(more on repo: http://code.google.com/p/git-repo/ )

Install the repo bootstrap binary: 

  mkdir ~/bin
  PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
  chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Create a directory for your oe-core setup to live in and clone the meta information. 

  mkdir oe-core
  cd oe-core
  repo init -u http://git.toradex.com/toradex-bsp-platform -b master
  repo sync

Create a development branch in all git repositories

  repo start mybranch --all



Source the file export to setup the environment. On first invocation this
also copies a sample configuration to build/conf/*.conf. Adapt local.conf to
your needs.

  . export
